# Mini-project

The mini-project is a group work which requires you to practice data analysis in order to contribute towards a humanities research question. A mini-project consists of two components:

* A **data analysis** contained into a single Jupyter notebook fully run and exported both as ipynb and html.
* A **short essay/report** structured as a research paper, which summarises your work. Please write no more than 4 A4 pages in a reasonable font size (excluding references, including everything else). Save your report as a pdf.

*Refer to Canvas for more guidelines.*

For the mini-project you have two options: do the **default mini-project** proposed below, or **come up with your own question(s) and dataset**. While there are no automatic grade bonus attached to coming up with your own mini-project, good ideas will be rewarded. At the same time, the default mini-project can still lead you to a full mark.

*Please follow the submission guidelines detailed in Canvas.*

## Default mini-project

**Research question: Are men overrepresented and women underrepresented in Hollywood movies?**

The [Bechdel test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test) was proposed as a means assess, and call attention to gender inequality in fiction. "It asks whether a work features at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man. The requirement that the two women must be named is sometimes added." (Wikipedia) The Bechdel test is [not without limitations](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/next-bechdel/), yet it is often considered as a low bar to meet.

Some years ago, [an article on The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/2017/03/bechdel/) used the Bechdel test to explore the movie industry, finding that about half of 200 movies in their sample failed the test. A [follow-up article](https://pudding.cool/2017/03/film-dialogue/) used dialogue data finding an overrepresentation of men and underrepresentation of women in movies. *You will make use the same dataset to directly explore the question yourself.*

For this mini-project, you are invited to explore the question by assessing the following:
* Is there an overrepresentation of men in movie dialogues?
* If so, how does it vary by age and over time?
* Is it correlated with box office gross earnings?

Make sure that your discussion includes your critical reflections on possible limitations of your analysis (and the dataset), as well as reference to more recent literature which might explore whether a shift has happened in recent times for movies released between 2016 and 2021.

### Dataset

The [original dataset](https://github.com/matthewfdaniels/scripts/) has been made available by the authors, alongside a [FAQ](https://medium.com/@matthew_daniels/faq-for-the-film-dialogue-by-gender-project-40078209f751) on it. Nevertheless, to make things a bit easier, you will use the [clean version](Pudding-Film-Dialogue-Clean.csv) (available in this repository) curated by Melanie Walsh for her book [Introduction to Cultural Analysis & Python](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/welcome.html) (which I highly recommend).

Check the [starting notebook](Mini_project_default.ipynb) for more info on what the dataset contains.

## Your own mini-project

If you would like to do your own mini-project, here are some great lists of datasets you might consider:

* [Melanie Walsh's compilation](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/Datasets/Datasets.html).
* [Miriam Posner's compilation](http://miriamposner.com/classes/dh201w21/final-project/datasets).
* [Data is plural](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit#gid=0). 

Please make sure to have a clear research question and understanding of the dataset before getting started. In case of doubt, ask us.
